# Online basketball scoreboard

This website is designed to track the scores of two teams during a basketball game. The user interface is simple and easy to use, allowing you to quickly update the scores as the game progresses.

The website is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, making it fast and responsive.

To update the score, you will find the buttons labeled +1, +2, +3 next to each team's name. Clicking on these buttons will add the corresponding number of points to the team's score. The current score will be displayed in the center of the page.

In case you want to reset the score, you can click on the "Reset" button located at the bottom of the page. This will set both teams' scores back to 0.

Please reach out to us in case you find any bugs or have any feedback to improve the website.
